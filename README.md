## Overview

The "FruitDetect" project harnesses the capabilities of neural networks to tackle the complex task of classifying 131 distinct fruit varieties based on their images. Identifying and categorizing fruits manually can be a daunting challenge due to the immense diversity in shape, size, color, and texture across different fruit types. The neural networks employed in this project possess the capability to learn intricate patterns and features from the input fruit images, enabling them to make highly accurate predictions regarding the fruit's class. Through the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning techniques, we have fine-tuned our models to recognize not only the most common fruits but also rare and exotic varieties.  

## Data

The dataset used for this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moltean/fruits) and can be imported using the Kaggle API. The dataset Fruits360 folder is organized into two main folders:

- **Train:** Contains subfolders labeled with the names of specific fruits or vegetables. Each subfolder contains images of the respective fruit or vegetable and will be used for model training.

- **Test:** Similar to the "Train" folder, the "Test" folder contains subfolders labeled with fruit or vegetable names. These subfolders contain images used for testing and evaluating our models.
